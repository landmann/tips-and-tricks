## Visual Studio Code

I use Visual Studio for all Javascript development at the moment. 
Here is a tutorial to get it up and running fast.

## Keyboard Mappings

I like to have my window split into two vertical windows, each of which contain different tabs.
To switch between windows, go to **Code > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts**, and change

```
workbench.action.focusNextGroup
workbench.action.focusPreviousGroup
workbench.action.previousEditorInGroup
workbench.action.nextEditorInGroup
```

I like to map them, in order, to `ctrl-k`, `ctrl-j`, `cmd-[`, and `cmd-]`.
