# Chrome

Totally unrelated to coding, but a _huge_ timesaver is to create a URL shortcut for your website. So, instead of typing `stackoverflow.com` you can just type `stacko` and hit enter, redirecting you to the stack overflow website.  To do this, follow these steps:

1. Right-click the address bar in Google Chrome and click Edit search engines... (or type chrome://settings/searchEngines in the address bar).
2. In the Other search engines table, scroll down, and click the Add a new search engine empty box.
3. In the `Add a new search engine` box, type the name of the shortcut (i.e bar).
4. In the `Keyword` box, type the shortcut keyword (i.e foo).
5. In the `URL with %s in place of query` box, type the URL of the website (i.e http://bar.com).
6. Then, if you type the keyword foo in the address bar, a suggestion named bar will pop up, and by clicking Enter, you will be redirected to http://bar.com.
